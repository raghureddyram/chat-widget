This project creates a chat widget that sits on a desktop of a given website. To access this widget, a user must have a google account because I've used google authentication to create users JIT.

The widget allows the user to interact with a chatbot that can generate and send files to the user. What happens is if the chatbot gets an instruction, it creates a temporary python file that it then executes. So for instance, to generate a csv report, an instruction set to create a python script to accomplish this task is first invoked. Then the executor determines what packages need to be installed, and executes the script in a subprocess. Finally the generated output file (if available) is moved into a directory that is namespaced by the requesting user id. A link with the file location is stored in the db, tied to the user, and available for easy file retrieval.
